Voter registration rates have yet to be studied closely, but this project reveals they are an untapped source of powerful information for campaigns and analysts. This project examines data from North Carolinaâ€™s voter files and Census Bureau population estimates to determine which types of areas tend to have lower rates of registered voters out of the total population. It includes statistical calculations, regression models, forecasting models, data visualizations, and analysis.
