Welcome to the official 2018/2019 DataGator competition website! The DataGator competition is a great way for undergraduates at the University of Florida to develop a data science portfolio that highlights their skills to potential employers. It is hosted by the data science education initiative, myDataStory. The competition also creates an informal learning opportunity, a fun way for you to hone your technical skills while mastering the fundamentals of data storytelling.  

We hope you'll consider submitting *your* story.  If you need inspiration, take a look at what others have done on our [portfolio page](/portfolio).
Here's some important information about the competition.

### Eligibility
Only registered UF students are eligible to participate.

### Submission Instructions
You will upload your submission as a link. This means that your project will have to have .html conversion capabilities and you will need to create a platform, either through GitHub or your own website, to publish your project. 

#### Prepare

Your submission must be through a clickable link on a browser interface. 

Some examples of submission formats include github served pages (described below), personal links published on websites, [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/), personal website hosted pages, and anything with a direct link that is accessible from the internet. 

You can export documents into .html format from Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) or from RStudio as a RMarkdown (.Rmd).

###### iPynb


1. In your Jupyter notebook, click on "File"
2. Move your cursor to "Download As"
3. Select the "HTML (.html)" option

###### RMarkdown


1. In RStudio, click on the arrow to the right of "Knit." 
2. Select "Knit to HTML."
3. A HTML version of your Rmarkdown file should appear in your working directory. 

#### Upload

From there, you can upload your .html file to the internet in multiple ways. If you have your own website, you may send in a link of the published project from your website. 

If you don't have a website and don't want to set one up, there is a quick way to create a link to submit:

1. First, you will need a GitHub account. If you do not have one, create one by following the instructions at https://github.com/join. Once you have made a GitHub account, make a repository. Instructions can be found here https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/. 

2. In your repository, upload the folder you are creating your project in (in either Rmarkdown or iPython) which includes the .html file.  

3. Click on the link that directs you to the .html file. For example:

https://github.com/mydatastory/r_intro_class/blob/master/_episodes_html/data_structures_part1.html

4. Now append http://htmlpreview.github.com/? to the beginning of your link. It will look like: http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/mydatastory/r_intro_class/blob/master/_episodes_html/data_structures_part1.html 

Congratulations! You now have a working link to submit. 

#### Submit 

Send your name, UFL email, phone number, major and year, and submission link to **mydatastory@gmail.com** with "Submission" in the subject line. Optional, but recommended: a brief description of your project and a small image from your project to host on the website. All submissions will be placed in the [portfolio](/portfolio) page.  

You may submit more than once up until the deadline, but we will only consider your latest submission. 

### **Deadlines**
All submissions must be received by midnight, February 15, 2019.

### **Winners**
Prizes will be awarded to the first, second, and third place winners.  The first-place winner will receive a $150 gift-card, the second-place winner's gift card will be $100, and the third-place winner's gift-card will be $50.
