      <description>Welcome to the official 2018/2019 MyDataStory competition website! The myDataStory competition is a great way for undergraduates at the University of Florida to develop a data science portfolio that highlights their skills to potential employers. The competition also creates an informal learning opportunity, a fun way for you to hone your technical skills while mastering the fundamentals of data storytelling.
We hope youâ€™ll consider submitting your story. If you need inspiration, take a look at what others have done on our portfolio page.</description>
